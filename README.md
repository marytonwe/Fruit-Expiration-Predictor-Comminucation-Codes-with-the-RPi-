Hello
This repository contains codes I used to enable some electronic components communicate with the Raspberry Pi. 
The goal of theis project was to create a device that can predict the date a fruit would expire however due to limited
data and time alloted to this project, we were able to create a device that predicts with a high degree of accuracy,
the expiration grade of a fruit in 4 categories: Unripe, Ripe, Overripe and Spoiled.

The best part is that the device is non-invasive, causes no harm to the fruit at all. 
With further development, food insecurity could be a problem of the past.
